# IEC 104

The IEC 104 driver in VC Hub communicates with substation devices over IEC 60870-5-104. You can add one IEC104 device, configure communication parameters, enable it, and then bind I/O tags to IEC 104 points.

For bulk import/export workflows, see [Batch Operation](batch-operation.md).

## **Connecting to an IEC 104 device**

1. On the **Devices** -> **IEC 104** page, click the **Add** button.
2. In the Add dialog, enter device information (the values below are examples; use your real project values):
    - Device Name: IEC104_1
    - Enable TLS: Disabled (or Enabled if your server requires TLS)
    - Server1: 127.0.0.1
    - Port1: 2404 or 19998 (TLS port)
    - Common Address: 1
    - Connection Timeout (ms): 10000
    - Receive APDU Timeout (ms): 10000
    - Command ACK Timeout (ms): 10000
3. Keep the default protocol parameters unless your device vendor requires different settings:
    - K: 12
    - W: 8
    - T0: 30
    - T1: 15
    - T2: 10
    - T3: 20
4. Configure **Sending / Polling Options** according to your server behavior:
    - **General Interrogation(s)**: Number of general interrogation commands sent in one polling cycle.
    - **Counter Interrogation Command(s)**: Number of counter interrogation commands sent in one polling cycle.
    - **Clock Synchronization Command(s)**: Number of clock synchronization commands sent in one polling cycle.
5. Configure **Advanced Configuration** (keep defaults unless your server requires custom frame formats):
    - **Originator Address**: Originator address used in IEC104 frames (typically `0`).
    - **Cause of Transmission Length(bytes)**: Byte length of the COT field (typically `2`).
    - **Common Address Length(bytes)**: Byte length of the common address field (typically `2`).
    - **Information Object Address Length(bytes)**: Byte length of the IOA field (typically `3`).
6. (Optional) Click **Test Connection** next to the configured server before saving.
7. Click **OK**. The new device is shown in the IEC104 device list.

8. In the device list, turn on **Enable Status** for the device.

9. On the device View page, server endpoint status is shown as Active or Standby. Only one endpoint can be Active: VC Hub checks endpoints in configured order and sets the first available endpoint to Active; once one endpoint is Active, all others remain Standby and are not connected.
    - **Active**: the server endpoint currently in use for connection.
    - **Standby**: configured endpoint not currently used for the active connection.

**Configuration Fields**

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Device Name | Name of the IEC 104 device connection. |
| Enable TLS | Enables TLS for IEC 104 communication. |
| Server1-Server4 | Up to 4 server IP/domain endpoints. |
| Port1-Port4 | Port for each server endpoint. |
| Test Connection | Verifies connectivity to the selected server endpoint. |
| Common Address | ASDU common address of the remote station. |
| Connection Timeout (ms) | Timeout for establishing TCP/TLS connection. |
| Receive APDU Timeout (ms) | Timeout for receiving IEC 104 APDU data. |
| Command ACK Timeout (ms) | Timeout waiting for command acknowledgment. |
| K / W | IEC 104 flow-control window parameters. |
| T0 / T1 / T2 / T3 | IEC104 timeout parameters (seconds). |
| General Interrogation Interval | Periodic GI interval. 0 means disabled. |
| Counter Interrogation Interval | Periodic counter interrogation interval. 0 means disabled. |
| Clock Synchronization Interval | Periodic clock sync interval. 0 means disabled. |
| Originator Address | Originator address used in IEC104 frames. |
| Cause Of Transmission Length | Byte length of COT field (1-2). |
| Common Address Length | Byte length of common address field (1-2). |
| Information Object Address Length | Byte length of IOA field (1-3). |

**Notes:**

1. **Enable Status** controls whether VC Hub attempts connection; **Connection Status** shows whether communication is currently established.
2. **Enable All** and **Disable All** are to enable or disable all data in the list.
3. GI/CI/CS intervals should match the capabilities of the target IEC104 server to avoid frequent request.

## **Tag Binding**

Bind I/O tags to data points from your IEC 104 device.

1. Create an I/O tag in the editor.

3. In the Data Source dialog, select the target IEC 104 device and fill in:
    - Common Address
    - ASDU Type
    - Information Object Address

4. Click **OK** to finish binding.

**Configuration Fields**

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Device Name | IEC 104 device selected from the device tree. |
| Common Address | Common address used by this tag binding (positive integer). |
| ASDU Type | IEC 104 ASDU Type ID; options are filtered by the tag data type. |
| Information Object Address | IEC 104 IOA for the target point (positive integer). |
