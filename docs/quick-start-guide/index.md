**Be ensured before installation:**

- The device must be accessible to the operator / administrator on the network. At the latest when the application has been installed on the target system, all further steps are carried out via the VC Hub web interface.

- To install the VC Hub, the technician requires administrative rights, meaning they must be a member of the root / sudo group on the target system.

- The target computer requires access to the Internet, as any packages that are not available during installation will be installed automatically. Access to the Internet is also required after installation for licensing the system with the Wago registration server. After that, Internet access is no longer necessary.

## 3. Install VC hub

### 3.3 Firewall Settings

#### 3.3.1 Why the Web Interface Cannot Be Accessed

If the web interface cannot be accessed via the selected port, it is highly likely that the host operating system's firewall is blocking the selected port.

Linux firewall mechanisms are very efficient, but configuring rules and port access requires some experience.

For security reasons, it is strongly recommended to block all incoming connections by default and explicitly allow only the ports that are required.

#### 3.3.2 Linux Firewall Overview (UFW)

Many Linux distributions now deliverd with the so called UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) tool pre-installed.

UFW simplifies the process of setting up the firewall. 

If the tool is not pre-installed, you can easily install it with the command `apt install ufw` or `sudo apt install ufw`.

To do this, the server needs an internet connection and the user performing the installation must do so as root or with root privileges.

![alt text](35.png)

#### 3.3.3 Configuring the Firewall Using UFW 

1. Check UFW status. After installation, UFW is typically inactive.

     `ufw status`

2. Deny all incoming connections by default. This blocks all inbound traffic unless explicitly allowed.

     `ufw default deny incoming`

3. Allow all outgoing connections by default. This ensures the system can initiate outbound connections.

     `ufw default allow outgoing`

4. Allow SSH before enabling UFW.

     If you are connected via SSH, this step is critical to avoid locking yourself out.

      `ufw allow ssh `

     UFW recognizes standard services like ssh.

     Alternatively, you can allow SSH by port number:

      `ufw allow 22`

5. Enable UFW

     `ufw enable `

     When prompted, type y and press Enter to confirm.

6. Verify firewall status and rules

     `ufw status`

     You should now see UFW status as active.

     ![alt text](36.png)

     If we have done everything correctly, we can no longer access the web interface of the VC Hub.

     ![alt text](37.png)

     You can find very good and detailed instructions on configuring UFW here:

     `https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-debian`

     ![alt text](38.png)

#### 3.3.4 Allowing Web Access Ports

**Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic**

Allow http (port 80): `ufw allow 80`

Allow https (port 443): `ufw allow https`

After enabling these rules, both HTTP and HTTPS access should work again in the web browser.

**Allow Additional Ports (Example)**

If you use other services or custom ports, you must allow those ports as well.

For example, you may need to enable port 9090 for the Debian web interface: `ufw allow 9090`

#### 3.3.5 WAGO Edge Computer Built-in Firewall (Firewalld)

The edge server is equipped with a built-in firewall that restricts access to most network ports. 

To ensure proper operation of the VC Hub, you can either 

- Disable the firewall entirely, or 

- Keep the firewall enabled and allow only the required ports

**Option 1 : Disable the Firewall (Not Recommended)**

Use the following commands to stop and permanently disable the firewall service:

`systemctl stop firewalld`

`systemctl disable firewalld`

**Note:**

- Disabling the firewall reduces system security. 

- This option is recommended only in trusted or isolated network environments.

**Option 2: Open the Required Ports (Recommended)**

To keep the firewall enabled and allow only the ports required for VC Hub operation, execute the provided configuration script:

```typescript
#!/bin/bash
# Open specified ports and make the changes permanent
# Define ports to open
PORTS=(8066 10443 8099 1883 8883)
# Loop through the ports and open each one
for port in "${PORTS[@]}"; do
    echo "Opening port: $port"
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=${port}/tcp
done
# Reload firewalld to apply changes
echo "Reloading firewalld rules..."
firewall-cmd --reload
# Display all open ports
echo "Currently open ports:"
firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

#### 3.3.6 Firewall Best Practices

- Block all incoming connections by default

- Explicitly allow only required ports

- Regularly review and maintain firewall rules

- Open additional ports only when expanding VC Hub functionality (e.g., instance communication or MQTT access)

## 4. VC Hub Structure

![alt text](39.png)

**Definition of Terms:**

**Node:** A node is an independent running instance of the VC Hub. Once the VC Hub is installed, it becomes a Node.

**Workspace** An workspace can be understood as an independent configuration container used to host the complete system configuration for a specific application scenario.It centrally manages configurations such as projects, devices, tags, alarms, scripts, databases, and permissions.Different workspaces are isolated from each other, and only one engineering can be running at a time.

**Project:** A Project represents a specific application scenario within the system. Each project can contain its own independent set of pages. All projects share the complete configuration of their associated workspace, including assets, devices, database connections, network settings, and other system-level configurations.

**Asset:** Asset is an abstract representation of a business object or physical object. It typically represents a real-world “object” such as a device, production line, or site. An asset can contain models, instances, and tags.
